Weechat Android Relay Client
==================================
This is an Android Weechat Relay client.
It is currently in beta status, with most things working.  I use it daily without issue.

This requires weechat to be running somewhere and it connects to it.  It is not a standalone weechat for your phone.  If you are looking for a standalone irc client for android, you will need to look elsewhere.

## Download
Weechat Android is available in the major app stores for Android.

#### Google Play
Either scan the QR code, or download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid).

##### Google Play Beta Version
Sometimes we make beta versions available in the google play store. These versions may be much more unstable, but are typically more up to date than the released version in the play store. To participate, you need to do two things:

Follow this link to "Become A Tester": https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid

Note: Make sure you're logged in to the same account you use for google play on your device.

Once you've done that if you install weechat-android from the play store you'll get the latest beta version. If you already have the app installed your device will update to the latest beta version.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can try the latest development version.  This is built after every commit, and while we try to keep a working build, it may fail or have major bugs. Use at your own risk.

### Google Play Nightly Builds
We now have automatic builds published to the google play store as commits are made. This is the same as the snapshot builds you can get above, just published to the google play store for convenience. It only includes builds of the master branch. These builds are published to the beta branch, so you need to be a beta test for this application.
