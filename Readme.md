Weechat Android Relay Client
==================================
This is an Android Weechat Relay client.

It was forked from ubergeek42's at version v0.08.
It has been modified to suit my own desires.

This requires weechat to be running somewhere and it connects to it.
It is not a standalone weechat for your phone.
If you are looking for a standalone irc client for android, you will need to look elsewhere.

If you are looking for the official weechat android app look here: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid).
